# GD2
This is a python library which can visualize the data from Gsheets which is present in your Gdrive.
The command to install this is pip install gsheetvis
and you can also refer about the recent changes and development phases at https://pypi.org/project/gsheetvis/


#IMPORTANT

This library currently can only access GDrive from my credentials so I've kept it under development phase.
Sooner I'd be updating it and will make it accessible for community use.
